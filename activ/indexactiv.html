                    <p>The Head of Economics Department of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics Vladimir Parhimenko shared his knowledge on creation of a successful startup with students of Inha University in Tashkent (IUT).

During the meeting, Parhimenko briefed the students about history of creation and development of the High Technologies Park (HTP) in Belarus. This park is one of the largest IT clusters in Central and Eastern Europe. The residents of the Park have developed several world-famous IT projects.

Vladimir Parhimenko noted that among the products of the residents of HTP were the online game World of Tanks, the application of free calls and messages Viber and others.

According to him, over 35% of employees of HTP are graduates of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radio electronics.

Parhimenko also spoke about activities on conducting researches and attracting private large IT companies into this process.

He also shared his knowledge on establishing successful startups with students of IUT.

Belarusian expert said that from the very beginning, the founders of startups need to put high demands to their ideas in order to prevent weak and unsustainable projects. He provided 10 filter-questions for startups, which will allow the founders of startups to determine successfulness of their projects.

Vladimir Parhimenko, in particular, shared his knowledge on building business models for a startup project and the models for project monetization, etc.
